# MAL8E

Mal-ocht-e - Mallachtaí - Curses.

## What?

A Hello-World level Scala.js project that randomly selects
a curse in the Irish language, and prints it to the console.

The selection of curses is drawn from
[this Irish Times article](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/54-irish-curses-you-won-t-have-learned-in-school-1.3011527).
Currently it's a hard-coded list. It may in the future migrate to a database.

## Why?

Toisc gur féidir liom.
